Did colonial and postcolonial socio-political institutions affect women in Africa in the same way racial conditions impacted women in the Diaspora? Are Africana artists feminists or womanists? And how helpful is race to our understanding of Africana identity and subjectivity?

Although many assume that African literature was only oral, not written, until the arrival of Europeans, Africans began writing stories about her by 1200 CE in the languages of Ethiopic, Coptic, & Arabic. This course explores this body of medieval African literature and paintings, preserved in African Christian monasteries, studying their themes of healing, reparative justice, & personal ethics in a violent world. It develops skills in the digital humanities & comparative literary studies.",

Social epidemiological theories, like the \"weathering hypothesis\", also attribute accelerated aging among Black Americans to biologized antiblackness.

Particular attention is paid to Black radicalism, to the ways various thinkers have imagined the relationship between theory and praxis, and to Black intellectual activity as a dynamic site of both critique and knowledge production.",

                "description": "This course explores Hollywood's fascination with imagining the end of the world. From Cold War mushroom clouds to submerged cities, zombie pandemics, and even the occasional meteor, Hollywood has dramatized the apocalypse in ways that reveal American society at the end of its rope. This course examines how apocalyptic films and series reflect political tensions, technological fears, religious narratives, and climate anxieties in different historical moments in the United States. Students will analyze works that span disaster blockbusters, speculative sci-fi, climate allegories, \"slow violence\" dramas, and documentary realism.",

Beginning with the publication of Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony (1975), we read novelistic form as a counternarrative to US origins stories. We explore the political context of the American Indian movement in relation to its literary renaissance. We revisit the past, including the nineteenth-century Indian Boarding School system and the \"Reign of Terror\" in the Osage Nation. We also consider the Native American novel in relation to film and poetry to think holistically about the arts from an interdisciplinary perspective.",

For each of these units we will spend one week reading a theoretical approach to understanding the theme, one week on an empirical case to put this theory in context, and one week reading a novel that works with the themes of the theory and research we have read.",

Understanding our evolutionary history is understanding both what we have in common with other primates and other hominins, and what happened over the last 7 to 10 million years since our divergence from the other African ape lineages. More specifically, the story of the human is centered in what happened in the ~2.5 million year history of our own genus (Homo). This class outlines the history of our lineage and offers an anthropological and evolutionary explanation for what this all means for humans today, and why we should care.",

How do they experience the cultural and political boundaries that define their place in the world?

We will consider such questions through the lens of anthropology, a discipline dedicated to tracking the ever-changing definitions of being human.

We assess their styles, modes of production, and realist truth claims as well as their capacities and constraints for doing anthropology. As inspiration, we study works by indigenous media makers that bring together visible and invisible ties among people, nonhuman species, and forces of nature. Our aim is to enlarge the creative possibilities for analyzing and representing today's pressing issues.",

We consider anthropology's contribution to understanding foundational legal questions related to liberalism, sovereignty, personhood and status, property, crime and punishment, and human rights, while inquiring into law's role in social control and transforming societies. Finally, we reflect on how anthropology helps us make sense of modern ideas around law as a tool for peace and justice.",

We draw on anthropology, history, critical theory, gender studies, and media to explore the processes and relationships by which men craft gendered lives. Rather than defining masculinity as biological trait or fixed object, we examine how men's life stories and prospects are shaped by social scripts, political-economic forces, labor regimes, and ethical norms.",

As we move across diverse geographies, we will explore how people's cultural values, moral standpoints and ethics shape their everyday experiences of climate change and their cultivation of alternate futures.",

Drawing on anthropology,\npolitical theory, and public policy analysis, it shows how authoritarian practices embed within democracy, shaping Human Rights and Public Policies. Through theory, case studies from Latin America, debates, and creative exercises, students develop tools to imagine dissent in the 21st century.",

We will see what is specific about the relation of knowledge and culture to power, and what this teaches us about the workings of colonialism and resistance to it.

While reading key texts in the discipline, we reflect on how scholars transition from fieldwork to theorizing, and from the ethnographic open to text and public engagement. Throughout, we attend to intellectual cross-pollinations and the ways ethnographic subjects become alternative figures of thought, redirecting modes of expression and restoring movement to ethical and political debates then and now.",

The historical focus on women and the broader imperative for justice have created productive tensions between theory, praxis, and advocacy.

Issues and ideas about space and form will be explored through a sequence of projects based on specific architectural representational techniques. The students will be confronted with progressively complex exercises involving spatial relations. The course will stress experimentation while providing an analytical and creative framework to develop an understanding of structure and materials as well as necessary skills in drawing and model making. Two three-hour studios with lectures included.",

Davis and Ta-Nehisi Coates, architectural discourse has only recently begun to engage with reparations.  Literature, research, and policy related to reparations intersect the built environment, urbanism, planetary climate crisis, postcolonialism, art history, and aesthetics.",

The inherent gap, between concept and program, is translated by language, figures of speech, and rhetoric. This ritual results in conceptual predicaments where the student's interest and its programmatic interpretation are (always) in conflict or (already) compromised. This course addresses these challenges by focusing on a process of design translation that extends concepts, described by language, to other complementary forms of representation.",

As models in other disciplines - such as climate change and economic models - clearly affect social behavior, how do architectural models change social behaviors? This course explores the symbolism and potential of the architectural model and its relationships to the myriad models that shape behaviors today.",

From community raising weekends and feminist pedagogical projects, to back-to-the land conversions and acts of preservation, throughout the rural United States these are sites where commonly held distinctions break down: between amateur participants and expert practitioners, between material culture and computational methods, between individuals and collectives, between manual trades and intellectual pursuits, between architectural discipline and building practice. This seminar begins by breaking down the barn, then designing and choreographing the raising of a new one.",

We study forms of organizing around women's and LGBTQ+ rights in cities, from the efforts of informal activist groups to those of institution building, and highlight these efforts as main sites for creative, architectural, and urban intervention in challenging heteronormative forms of living and instead providing spaces of care and kinship making.",

Through a combination of artmaking exercises, close visual analysis, readings, and discussions, students cultivate new approaches to understanding how artworks function as both cultural artifacts and creative expressions.

We take a thematic approach, looking at how physical traces of the past inform our understanding of aspects of Roman life such as political representation, household life, commerce and trade, gender and ethnicity, and engineering and technology. We consider both what is traditionally classified as \"art\" - sculpture, painting, and mosaics - and as \"archaeology\"- ceramics, organic remains, and utilitarian objects- and explore how the two types of evidence fit together. Our goal is to learn about the Romans through a close examination of the world they made for themselves.",

Mobilizing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks and foregrounding first-hand engagement with art on campus, it introduces contemporary art as a vital means to comprehend and reimagine our disputed, but incontrovertibly shared globality today.",

The course introduces the arts of Catholicism, Orthodoxy,\nJudaism, and Islam; great courts and migratory societies; works made for private use\nand public display. Through narrative arc in lecture and precepts dedicated to artistic\nmedia, textual and material primary sources, and/or key intellectual themes, we consider\nhow art participates in forming sacred and secular power. We explore how the work of\n'art' in this period carries powers of its own, and how art shaped a multi-lingual, multi-confessional, multi-cultural medieval world.",

This course examines invention in European art from around 1400 to 1650, a period that (unlike contemporary ideas about unprecedented originality) considered imitation as a paradigmatic mode of innovation. As well as exploring historical modes of creative imitation, we examine theories of imagination, the intersection of new technologies and materials with artistic ingenuity, the marketing of authenticity through signatures, copyrights and novel technique, concepts of authorship and collaboration, and the rise of fakes.",

How do they reckon with changing circumstances in the present? How have painting and sculpture in certain moments succeeded or failed in remaining aesthetically and culturally vital? What happens when artists turn to \"new media\" (television, video, digital technologies)? What roles do museums and international exhibitions play in shaping artistic practice? How has art responded to and produced knowledge about the Holocaust, decolonization, migration, nuclear warfare, political violence, climate emergency?",

                "description": "The most fascinating art objects from Africa primarily depict supernatural beings and were often used for religious and ritual activity. This course returns these objects to their original contexts; it helps us develop fuller appreciation of these art works now in collections around the world, and the different ways African societies used art and religion to enrich their experience of life and the afterlife. We examine how Africans imagined their world through religion, and how art - objects, images, and performances - were/are used to articulate and make sense of the encounter of humans with a complex, exciting, and bewildering world.",

These monuments are constantly transforming -- pilgrims seek to be buried in the shadow of saintly sepulchres, shrines become complexes with ancillary structures, additional monuments, courtyards, and other open spaces. As they expand, they become significant public spaces, places of sociability and of communal gathering. Through close architectural analysis and literary study, this seminar explores funerary landscapes and their connection with urban spaces in the subcontinent.",

Through the study of aesthetic experiments across media and readings in existentialist, feminist and Marxist philosophy, artists' writings, art criticism and art history, we investigate how art was politicized by artists and their publics from the Nazi Occupation through the French riots of 2005.",

We consider architectural history in an era when the nature of modern warfare changed drastically and permanently. In general, this seminar explores the tools that architects used to consider relationships between invention and tradition, craft and art, material and form, ancient and modern. We study works by Alberti, Serlio, Philibert de l'Orme, and Michelangelo, among others, and take a transnational and transmedial approach to the study of key developments in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century architecture.",

Once an obsequious gesture, cringe now names an embarrassed response when acts of self-presentation misfire, and in the 21st c. it has become a derogatory label for awkward earnestness. This course examines cringe as surplus feeling: sincerity tipping into humiliation, provoking shame and even aggression. We pair Asian American literature with theories of aesthetics and capitalism, tracing cringe's ambiguous ties to camp, satire, and irony, and to racialized affects like cuteness and animacy, to consider how cringeness troubles judgments of authenticity, failure, and success.",

Students study ASL children's plays, international visual theater, and one-act plays while engaging with guest Deaf artists. Since students in Princeton's ASL program are still developing fluency, the course helps hone expressive and receptive signing skills through rehearsal, performance, and devising. The semester culminates in the Visual Vaudeville Project, an ensemble showcase highlighting the dynamic interplay of language, culture, and performance.",

The course bridges classical structural mechanics with modern advances in composites and architected materials. Topics include trusses, pressure vessels, fiber-reinforced composites, discrete lattices, and metamaterials. Through a combination of lectures, labs, and hands-on demonstrations, students will develop skills in static and dynamic analysis, modeling, and testing of various structures. These skills provide a strong foundation for innovative applications across engineering fields.",

The approach goes beyond the perception of \"safety\" as a cap, thus encouraging creativity in delivering \"safer designs\" as a benefit to society. Concepts are illustrated via case studies that include Bhopal pesticide plant disaster, World Trade Center collapse, and the Firestone and Ford tire controversy. A personal project is at the core of the learning process where the student illustrates achieving safe and functional design outcomes in an area of their own choosing.",

This course will be taught at half the pace of instruction compared to Elementary Chinese (CHI 101/CHI 102). The goal is to develop students' competence in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Both the Pinyin Romanization system and simplified characters will be used in class. After taking CHI 1001 and CHI 1002, students will develop basic abilities to handle simple survival situations in Chinese, to read and write over 300 Chinese characters, and be well prepared for more advanced and intensive study in Chinese.",

After a coverage of aromaticity and the chemistry of benzene, we then move into the heart of the course: the nature and reactivity of the carbonyl group, a subject that is central to both mainstream organic chemistry and biochemistry. Throughout this course, an effort will be made to demystify the art of chemical synthesis. This course is appropriate for chemistry majors, premedical students, and other students with an interest in organic chemistry and its central position in the life sciences.",

The first unit focuses on basic terms in the debate: for instance, what do we mean by \"enhancement,\" \"treatment,\" and \"cognition\"? The second unit addresses some questions in the literature, including whether or not we have (or would have) a duty to enhance ourselves given certain technologies. The third unit explores some political ramifications of enhancement, including eugenic and distributive concerns. The fourth unit will focus on present-day case studies, through group presentations.",

What is the relationship between slavery and race? Gender? Religion? We will encounter several views on these questions, attending to how they emerge in historical context. Beginning with ancient Greek and Roman accounts of slavery and freedom, we will develop some conceptual tools to analyze medieval and modern theories and practices of slavery, including the enslavement of Indigenous peoples and Africans and the American anti-slavery movement.",

Much of this work has adopted a comparative perspective, and multiple global histories of enslavement have now appeared in print. Ranging from the Neolithic to the 21st century, this course will offer a survey of the history of human bondage. Topics to be explored include the role of slavery in the rise of the first Neolithic states; the institutionalization of slavery in ancient Mesopotamia, the Greco-Roman Mediterranean, and ancient China; and the proliferation of slave systems elsewhere in Eurasia and on the African continent.",

Areas of competition include: chariot, horse and foot-races, boxing, wrestling, dance, gladiatorial fights, beast-hunts, public executions and more. We will also consider leisure activities (swimming, hunting, board games), magic and curses, sport medicine and diet, and gambling. We close with the direct interaction of Christianity with Roman spectacle entertainment and the after-life of the games in this new world order.",

The reliance of democratic politics on memorable oratory stems from traditions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome which were revived in the modern era of parliamentary debates and stump speeches. This course will analyze the rhetorical structure of famous political speeches over time in a bid to better understand the potent mixture of aesthetics and ideology that characterizes political rhetoric, as well as the equally long tradition of regarding political rhetoric as insincere and unscrupulous. Students will try their hand at political speech-writing and oratory in class.",

Over millennia, these and several other labels have been ascribed to the Macedonian ruler, Alexander III (r.336-323 BC), best known as Alexander the Great. Egypt, Babylonia, Iran, India. Alexander's domination of the Persian Empire brought the Greeks into more direct and violent contact with the peoples of these regions than ever before, with reverberations that are felt till today. Each week, we will use ancient literature to first trace how Alexander's conquests unfolded. Then we will use inscriptions and archaeology to explore the rich pasts of the communities affected by Alexander's arrivals.",

In this seminar, we will explore the history of this concept from the warrior-societies of archaic Greece to the salons of the European Enlightenment, taking in writers like Plato, Cicero, Augustine and Montaigne along the way. This course encompasses twelve weeks, with two classes per week: each week, we will read a new classical, medieval or early modern author, all in translation.",

Attention is given to cases where the numismatic evidence varies from that supplied by written, archaeological, and visual sources. Each student follows a region through the period of transition, considering questions of minting and circulation, and produces weekly reports and a final project. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students; no previous numismatic training is expected.",

We'll explore the play's interrogation of how physical suffering makes and unmakes\nhuman beings - both those in pain and those called upon as witnesses. We will pay close attention to the Greek text, while also considering the play in relationship to other representations of physical pain in tragedy. We'll also look at the play's recent reception history, from Seamus Heaney's Cure at Troy to a recent adaptation by a female combat veteran.",

Looking at texts that have been banned and burned in Spain, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, this course covers Hispanophone literature and culture from the 16th-20th centuries: the contexts of colonial expansion, Latin American dictatorships, and imperial vestiges in the transatlantic world. It also examines debates about gender and racial politics, historical revisionism, hegemonic global powers, language globalization, and academic freedom.",

Drawing from literary and theoretical works we will examine how maritime life and infrastructures - from the slave ship to the death ship, from container terminals to coral reefs - have shaped imperial fantasies, climate crises and the production of global hierarchies. We will track the emergence of projects to exploit the ocean out of practices of governing the colonies, the plantation, the factory floor, racialized and gendered bodies. Finally, we will explore the sea's submerged history as the spawning ground of radical horizons, epistemological overhaul and speculative futures.",

We focus on key concepts, such as social reproduction, the body, and the enclosures to approach how the question of the commons is articulated at different international and historical contexts. We establish a dialogue with contemporary thought and analysis generated by different social movements, paying special attention to the relevance of her work in Latin America.",

In reading key texts from the debates around the concept and practice of world literature, we ask whether its universalizing drive can be reconciled with literary/scholarly investments in locality and specificity. How, moreover, do world literature and translation intersect with questions of empire, race, and non-national formations, especially diaspora? Throughout the semester, we consider the implications for our own work as scholars.",

Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves & others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications.  Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.",

                "description": "The single-semester IW course (399) requires BSE juniors to complete a substantial piece of research and scholarship under the supervision and advisement of a Princeton faculty member. The work requires sustained investment and attention throughout the semester. Information about works-in-progress submissions, due dates, and how students' final grades are calculated are outlined below. Students can pursue Independent Work driven by their interests and skills. The work must result in a final paper. Offered in the spring, juniors are provided with an opportunity to concentrate on a \"state-of-the-art\" project in computer science.",

                "description": "Computation and other aspects of our lives are becoming increasingly intertwined. We will study topics on the cusp between economics and computation. The focus will be on the mathematical and computational tools involved in the interaction of economics and computation. Topics: matching, auctions, mechanism and market design, computational social choice. The aim of the course is: (1) to understand the game-theoretic issues behind systems involving computation such as online networks, (2) to learn how algorithms and algorithmic thinking can help with designing better decision and allocation mechanisms in an offline world.",

Our foundation myths and fables are speculative fiction, and their current of fear and wonder runs straight through to contemporary science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In this class, we'll learn about some fascinating genre traditions, embrace experimentation, and try to build universes that won't (per Philip K. Dick) fall apart two days later. A mix of mind-bending readings, stimulating class discussions, and eccentric writing assignments will inspire our own forays into the slipstream.",

We'll dive into personal, social, and performance practices, think about improvisation as both end in itself and a key aspect of creative processes in other art forms and fields as diverse as science, philosophy, and religion. On Wednesdays we'll build our skills and resources; on Fridays we'll put them to use in a co-created improvisation laboratory.",

                "description": "This course tells the epic story of the people, ideas, and institutions that made the first Chinese empires, ca. third century BCE to the first century BCE. The course looks at the rise and fall of the Qin empire as well as the way Qin institutions and ideas reverberated through the succeeding Han dynasty--and beyond. Course will cover most recent archeological materials and excavated texts (in translation), including ongoing excavations of the terracotta warriors, funerary art, excavated legal codes, legal cases, religious and philosophical texts, and much more. Finally, we ask: did the Qin empire ever end?",

We will watch at least two films per week, one of which will be screened in theater. These include works of the colonial and war periods, but the majority are recent productions. Our thematic focus will be on the material and epistemic transformations wrought by the global neoliberal order and on new forms of racialized, gendered and techno-socialized subjectivity. Our core principle is that the films' peculiar insights into contemporary Korea can only be captured through careful attention to their forms.",

We consider both the insufficiency and excess of medical care as it shapes the conditions of life and death itself and contested terminologies of choice and eligibility. The transfer of human materials in organ transplantation shapes our moral understanding of what we owe one another and the definition of death itself. Technologies such as glucometers bring new possibilities and inequalities. Medical aid in dying is both compassionate and signals the limits of social care.",

For example, SOEs create new functionality ultra-thin optical systems in a thickness < 1 micron. The main course topics include: (1) rigorous Maxwell theory for SOEs, (2) mean-field theory for SOEs, (3) non-resonant SOEs, (4) resonant SOEs (photonic crystals), (5) nano-plasmonics, and (6) active optical devices using SOE.",

Microeconomics focuses on the decisions made by consumers and producers, the interactions between them and the resulting markets. We will consider a variety of market structures ranging from perfect competition to monopoly. We will also explore individual behavior under uncertainty and discuss the rationale for government involvement in market activity.",

It introduces key concepts such as saving, borrowing, interest rates, risk, and diversification. It also provides an overview of important financial products and services such as bank accounts, retirement accounts, mutual funds, mortgages, credit cards, and insurance. Students learn to avoid common financial mistakes due to inertia and behavioral biases. Key concepts are illustrated through real world examples and homework exercises with practical calculations.",

In particular we will learn how to model the behavior of individual decision makers, and how to aggregate their behavior to better understand the way larger institutions operate. A lot of the class will be geared towards a fundamental economic institution *the market* to develop a better understanding of when it thrives, and when it fails.",

The first part of the course develops a framework for the analysis of households' consumption and savings behavior and firms' production decisions, and uses that to analyze growth, inequality, asset prices, and fiscal policy. The second part of the course extends that analysis to examine business cycle fluctuations, including unemployment and inflation. Current issues in macroeconomic and economic policy are discussed throughout.",

A third part of the course discusses informational imperfections, going from search frictions to adverse selection moral hazard, and coordination failures. The course concludes with a discussion of government failures.",

This is a more math-focused version of ECO 321. For most topics considered, we will write down and solve a model of firm behavior, before considering real-world examples of the phenomenon the model seeks to analyze. We will use the examples to assess the model's ability to capture real-world outcomes.",

We then analyze trade policy, investigating the economic and political motives for government intervention and its effects on national welfare. The course concludes by addressing pressing contemporary challenges, including the reordering of the post-WWII global trading system, the strategic role of industrial policy, the future of the WTO and regional trade agreements, and transformations in global value chains.",

This course departs from this view and discusses how inefficiencies arise due to psychology and limits to arbitrage. The psychology of investors shapes their preferences and may impair their judgment. Whether these psychological factors have an impact on financial markets ultimately depends on arbitrageurs' ability to fight against mispricings. These issues will be covered through lectures and class games and will allow discussions about cognitive illusions and speculative bubbles.",

The course is targeted to both empiricists (especially in Industrial Organization and Development) and theorists. Writing theory for a specific application requires a critical reading of standard models, as well as a careful evaluation of the merits of sophistication. The course emphasizes two key aspects: Constructing a streamlined, core model that captures essential forces, and deliberately incorporating more complex elements as needed to serve the ultimate application.",

Specific topics include an overview of broad development patterns, development accounting, misallocation, structural change, premature deindustrialization, the role of agriculture in development, market imperfections, and risk-sharing. The second half of the course focuses on macro implications of micro imperfections. We explore the implication of labor market frictions and financial frictions for income distribution, economic growth and fluctuations. We examine the roles and the limitations of public policies for improving resource allocation and welfare.",

Special emphasis is placed on the evolution of fascism as a form of political ideology, on the expression of fascist ideas in film and architecture, and on the question whether fascism can be understood as a matter of individual and collective psychology. Students will become familiar with a range of theories of fascism, as well as larger trends in twentieth-century visual culture and literature.",

From Spain to Austria and from England to Latin America, the story of the cunning charmer has been told and retold in literature, painting, theater, opera, and film. This seminar will explore the major works focusing on the character of Don Juan by authors such as Tirso de Molina, Mozart, Molière, Lord Byron, and Pasolini. What makes Don Juan irresistible? What makes him a timeless figure, one that continues to fascinate in our time? We will discuss readings by critics from Freud to Jordan Peterson.",

How have genes and circuits evolved to generate the incredible diversity of behaviors we see across the animal kingdom? This course will explore these questions with emphasis on recent advances in the primary literature. Each class will focus on a specific behavior with a lecture introducing what is known about its genetic and neural basis followed by a discussion of a paper that builds on that knowledge to examine how the behavior evolves. A major goal of the class will be to learn how to critique contemporary research, generate new hypotheses, and design experiments to test those hypotheses.",

Through collaborative projects, students learn to make conjectures, formulate interesting questions, and discover patterns. The course culminates with publicly exhibited projects. Students can expect to be pushed out of their comfort zones and approach math in new ways. This highly participatory course includes interactive exercises adapted from the arts (e.g. improvisational theater) for developing communication, observation, and collaboration skills.",

There is a fundamental mismatch between our normal ways of approaching problems and the new open, complex, dynamic and networked challenges facing us today. To approach the new reality we need to fundamentally shift the way we think and act. This course introduces the logic and the practices to do so through a novel approach to design. We will explore HOW to create space for the deep change we really need.",

The studio is highly discussion-based and collaborative: students learn by critiquing, iterating, and building together. We begin with how humans think about the future, then examine how design disciplines approach emerging challenges. Students practice core foresight methods (horizon scanning, trend analysis, and scenario planning) and translate insights into tangible outcomes: scenarios, prototypes, design fictions, and strategy briefs that address technology, society, and the environment.",

In recent years this has resulted in ever increasing pledges by nations, states and organizations to reach net-zero by midcentury. Not well understood are the immense scale and speed of this transformation. Princeton's Net-Zero America study and similar studies elsewhere have provided highly granular insights on the implications for the environment, finances, jobs, and diverse stakeholder interests. Students will build on these insights with interdisciplinary case studies for ambitious international net-zero hubs.",

We read diversely from Chaucer to Shakespeare, Milton, Austen and others, to trace the origins of our own modernity. What did reading and writing mean in the early modern world? Are they different today? We examine England in relation to the globe, and we ask who gets included and excluded from \"great books.\" What do people, places and situations that existed on the margins of early English society and literature teach us about the problems we currently face? Does seeing things their way help us view our own world differently?",

Readings draw from political theory, critical theory, and cultural studies, asking how fascism evolves in response to crises of capitalism, migration, and globalization. Students will engage key debates about ideology, mass psychology, and media, with attention to how cultural and political forms articulate with authoritarianism.",

Frankenstein delivers a Creature of anomalous body to  pervasive social prejudices that doom him to abuse, loneliness, and existential misery. These course-pillars will be take on  related works by both authors and the curious case of The Savage Boy (1802).",

This course surveys all of the above, focusing on works written in twelfth-century France, where the concepts of romantic love and secular literature emerged hand in hand, and fourteenth-century England, where love became subject for satire and philosophical examination. In the process, we will read some exceptionally good poetry. No previous experience with medieval literature is required or expected.",

Why has it been burned, defaced, and censored? How does the dynamic paratext of a book, from illustrations through doodles, shape and witness readers then and now?

What do the plays suggest about physically constrained or liberated bodies as a source of dramaturgical invention?

Marriage is never quite the simple union of two people, but always involves a third term: another person, a sum of money, a past or a future, a different world, perhaps the idea of marriage itself. This course explores these third terms of marriage by revisiting the marriage plot, both its defining instances in the nineteenth century and subsequent reverberations. Attending to the transformations of a narrative form, we will explore the unsuspected complications, even moral hazards, and the new social futures awaiting those seeking or avoiding marriage as a life-defining goal and commitment.",

What difference does gender make, as a socio-culturally contingent set of values and practices and a category not determined by sex? What happens when we study Barbauld, Robinson, Smith, Wollstonecraft, Wordsworth (Dorothy), Hemans, Austen, Mary Shelley (Mary)?",

Because of time constraints, we spend less time on <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. Reading <i>Ulysses</i>  occupies most of our time together. Each of the 18 episodes are paired with critical or theoretical readings allowing us to explore important interpretive models for approaching Joyce and modern/contemporary literature, including poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, gender and sexuality, cultural studies, history, law and literature, and political theory.",

                "description": "This course explores the relation between theories of memory and the rise of a postcolonial aesthetic from the late colonial period to the present. The basic assumption is that the literature and discourse of decoloniality is haunted by debates and disputes about memory and that memory is the third term between time and space. When, why, and how did memory become the political unconscious of late colonialism and narratives of decoloniality? And how does a focus on the work of memory in literary texts transform our understanding of postcolonial theories, histories, and texts?",

We will define these terms capaciously, to include reappropriations of colonial archives, theories of African, Black, and Indigenous gazes, and case studies in the global art restitution movement. Specific topics and questions might include data healing, digital rematriation, and reparative approaches inspired by African, feminist, and queer artists and writers. In asking about giving photographs back, we will learn to live with pictures that arrive unbidden, carry material residues of history, and provoke ancestral returns.",

From past efforts to entrench fossil fuels to the historical inequalities that have shaped which communities are most vulnerable to climate disasters, the past looms large in the present and future. This class explores the history of global warming in three parts. The first part, Crisis, focuses on its causes and controversies. The second, Energy and Mitigation, explores past experiences with low-carbon energy and other mitigation strategies. The third part, Extreme Weather and Adaptation, covers past experiences with the extreme weather at the frontlines of the crisis.",

In this workshop-style course, students make frequent visits to Rare Books in Firestone and gain hands-on experience with techniques such as writing with a quill, setting type for printing, composing a letter for the royal post, and using early French dictionaries. We examine how technological changes shaped the development of the French language, as well as French culture and politics.",

Her groundbreaking feminist opus <i>The Second Sex</i> challenged taboos and sparked transnational political movements. This course explores Beauvoir's interdisciplinary work and legacy through multiple media. Pairing her writings with responses from contemporary authors and filmmakers (including Sara Ahmed, James Baldwin, Annie Ernaux, Paul B. Preciado, and Agnès Varda), we will investigate why her radical techniques continue to inspire feminist activists and artists today.",

They don't share the same stories and might have very different ways of telling them. We will discuss, as well, the reception of these books in French society, via press articles or emissions, and how they fit (or not) in the main representations of what is a \"good immigrant\" and of what is a \"good book\".",

It explores the physicality of manuscripts, fragments, and amulets, while treating poetry and music as forms of 'matter' beyond metaphor. Through canonical and non-canonical works from Marie de France to incantations in (faux) Hebrew students gain skills to navigate medieval poetry and music, and to reassess 'modern' corpuses through the lens of multisensory engagement. The course is taught in French.",

They remain a unique lens through which to interrogate and understand innovation, manufacturing, and industrial design. Recently, shoes have refocused our attention on issues of ethics and morality. Shoes are a window into our personal and collective history and future. Students in this seminar will explore, through the evolution of shoes, seminal interdisciplinary ideas, build and refine their academic skills, and create a measurable impact on campus.",

We also consider the specific language used in their essays and reflect on the struggle to put experiences into words. To better understand this process, students keep a weekly journal and write two essays during the term.",

At first sight that seems obvious: novelists make things up, whereas scholars document the truth. Yet on closer inspection they have a lot in common: both use similar techniques to construct narratives and convince their readers. Sometimes the dividing line between truth and imagination is blurred. Should we care about that? What does \"truth\" mean, anyway? History and Fiction are a lot closer than you think. But that doesn't make them the same. Learn how writers construct fictional and historical narrative and try your hand at both.",

Urban art is more than decoration--it is a voice. This course explores street art and graffiti as creative resistance, cultural identity, and social justice worldwide. From Chicano murals in LA to Quinta do Mocho in Portugal, students examine how artists use public space to challenge oppression, resist commercialization, and reclaim identity. Through case studies, discussions, and hands-on projects, we'll explore gentrification, migration, and AI in urban art.",

We will go in close on the textures and rhythms of each; think, talk, and write about how each re-calibrates our concept of seeing and then submit a final paper with a different eye toward engaging with sensations, ideas, questioning.",

However, since not all dialects are equally accepted, some speakers might feel judged because of their way of talking. We will analyze the reasons behind the belief that some language varieties are better than the rest, and debunk that myth. We will look at several examples of dialects in the US, around the globe and especially in the country of Barbados, and we will study linguistic situations like multilingualism in our society.",

Students will engage works from four distinctly Greek literary traditions- epic poetry, tragedy, history, and philosophy.",

Why is hell so alive in secular culture today? This course explores the literary topos of the descent into the underworld in several strands of literary culture in the west. In the seminar, we will discuss underworld themes and archetypes in western and eastern antiquity, the Middle Ages, as well as modern and contemporary literature and visual art. Understanding the curious attraction of hell will help us conceptualize what the realm of the dead means for how we inhabit the world of the living.",

In this seminar, we will explore the history of modern communications technology from a non-technical perspective. Starting with the evolution of Bell Labs and the invention of the transistor in 1949, every decade since has seen a path-breaking invention.",

We will apply inspired tactics to our own work. Spanish not required. Acting experience not required. Willingness to play and take risks is integral to class.",

Because of the universality of childhood, scholars from many disciplines are interested in understanding what it means to be a child, the ways in which children grow, and how societies support children. In this seminar, we will explore what it means to be a child. We will consider perspectives on childhood and development from a range of disciplines, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, law, medicine, and literature.",

This course uses a case of displacement--when 1.3 million refugees came to Greece in 1922--to explore widely and pressingly relevant issues: the construction of ethnic identity, the intertwining of politics and class, infrastructural responses to humanitarian crisis, and debates over cultural authenticity. We also explore how the Greek case set a precedent for later receptions of migrants there and forced migrations elsewhere. Throughout the course we reflect on identity and community, our goals and commitments, and the real-world stakes of academic work.",

Despite their divergent backgrounds and outlooks, many of them came to see totalitarianism as a systematic distortion of the human person's connection to reality, which led them to some remarkably similar reflections on how that connection might be reestablished.",

Reading psychoanalytic writings by Freud, Ferenczi, Lacan, Klein, Laplanche, and others, paths and detours lead to problems of terminology, translation, mediation. Addressing works of art and literature, questions arise about how those works might be understood as instances of psychoanalytic criticism and/or critiques of psychoanalysis. A need for critical reflection on the meaningfulness of psychoanalytic theories for current scholarship in the humanities is a guiding concern of this seminar. Seminar guests include practicing psychoanalysts.",

How does trans- operate in poetic language and other forms of art resisting stability to bring about \"the new\"? Trans- points to processes and mutations, as suggested by its iterations. While \"transgression\" peaked in theory around 2000, \"translingualism\" is still flourishing. We engage with the potential of trans- from \"translation\" to \"corecore\".",

Indeed, the present is haunted by the past as much as it is by unrealized visions of the future. At a time when a culture of amnesia threatens to enclose the horizon of the future, critical ghost studies become even more relevant.

Featured writings include the Aksumite royal inscriptions, early Bible translations, monarchic chronicles, saintly hagiographies, hymns, homilies, and the improvisational Qene tradition. You will learn advanced grammar and develop a deeper understanding of literary style and history.",

How do gender and sexuality emerge from networks of power and social relations? And how are they entangled and co-constituted with other axes of identity such as class, race, ethnicity, nationality, and ability? As we survey a wide variety of writers, texts, issues, and methods in equal parts humanistic and social scientific, we will engage the diversity of thought and approach contained under the rubrics of feminist, gender, sexuality, queer, and trans studies as foundation for further work in the field.",

Drawing on decolonial, Indigenous, and feminist thought, we examine how genocidal projects target reproductive life, sexual and familial structures, and community survival. Students will engage reproductive justice frameworks, survivor testimony, and Palestinian feminist critiques of colonial violence, while situating Gaza within comparative histories of the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, and genocide against Black and Indigenous populations. Colloquium sessions feature leading feminist scholars.",

Engage with biblical texts, Kabbalistic writings, art, music, and questions of culture that emerge from the alphabet, while addressing grammatical topics that arise. Appreciate Hebrew as both a linguistic system and a cultural treasure. The course will be conducted primarily in Hebrew.",

The course opens up a rich, layered legal past, one in which the law was never a single thing and was always in motion: it was a source of authority that mediated and shaped social and political conflicts within the United States, even as those conflicts also changed the law. You will leave class with an overview of U.S. legal history and an appreciation for the complicated roots of current legal issues.",

It looks at the global legacies of the French and Russian revolutions, and how the Industrial Revolution augmented the power of European states, sometimes through formal and sometimes informal imperialism. How did ideologies like nationalism, liberalism, communism and fascism emerge from European origins and how were they transformed? How differently did Europeans experience the two phases of globalization in the 19th and 20th centuries? Biographies are used as a way of approaching the problem of structural change.",

This course introduces students to the history of the modern Ethiopian state and its role shaping moments and movements in global history. It highlights the way African histories are essential to, but often ignored (or erased) in the telling of modern world history. Students will engage with primary and secondary historical texts, literature, and film.",

The island was among the last places in the hemisphere to abolish slavery, yet home to the first black political party in the Americas. After the revolution of 1959, among the most radical of the modern world, it became an important international symbol of third world socialism and anti-imperialism, and an unexpected focus of global Cold War struggles. This course serves as an introduction to that fascinating history and to the major themes that have shaped it: race and slavery; nationalism and empire; revolution and socialism.",

It focuses on three major questions: (1) What brought Asians to the United States? (2) How did Asian Americans come to be viewed as a race? (3) How does Asian American experience transform our understanding of U.S. history?  Using newspapers, novels, government reports, and films, this course will cover major topics in Asian American history, including Chinese Exclusion, Japanese incarceration, transnational adoption, and the model minority stereotype.",

Students will immerse themselves in primary documents from three critical historical events: the Salem Witch Trials, the Dawes Act and Native American policy, and the Little Rock school integration crisis. Using those primary documents as raw material, students will practice writing their own histories. We will stress interpretation of documents, the framing of historical questions, and construction of historical explanations.",

Major themes include: the impact of imperialism, tensions between governance and dissent, the rise of nationalism, the political stakes of historical interpretation, and the significance of China's history for its present and future.",

This course examines the origins and development of the Crusades and the Crusader States in the Islamic East. It explores dramatic events, such as the great Siege of Jerusalem, and introduces vivid personalities, including Richard the Lionheart and Saladin. We will consider aspects of institutional, economic, social and cultural history and compare medieval Christian (Western and Byzantine), Muslim and Jewish perceptions of the crusading movement. Finally, we will critically examine the resonance the movement continues to have in current political and ideological debates",

It explores how grand schemes for world parliaments, universal peace, and human rights as well imperial domination and dismal violence shaped today's world system. Can great power politics be squared with global ethics, with self-determination, with environmental protection? Is there such a thing as just war? We will investigate shifting answers to these questions in conversation with figures like Kant, L'Ouverture, Marx, Wilson, Du Bois, Lenin, Hitler, Ho Chi Min, Arendt, Hayek, and Nkrumah.",

Why did it end with the creation of a fractious independent republic, an \"empire of liberty\" rooted in slavery? This class explores the causes, course, and consequences of the American Revolution, from the Seven Years War through the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Lectures, readings, and precepts will trace the ideas and experiences of the many peoples whose lives intersected with the United States' struggle for independence: female and male, Black and white and Native American, free and enslaved, American and British, Loyalist and Patriot.",

In covering the history of the human use of data, we will learn how data are used to reveal insight and support decisions, how data-driven practices make historical and literary arguments, and how data and culture are fundamentally intertwined.",

How did society regulate medical practice and cope with public health crises? And what was it like to be sick? We will trace innovations in surgery, anatomy, and midwifery, and explore how healers balanced Greek and Arabic medical knowledge with practical experience and observation. We will also examine the role of herbal remedies, religious healing, astrology, alchemy, and the rise of global commerce in medicinal drugs.",

It explores how psychiatry moved out of the asylum into the general population where proponents of mental hygiene emphasized the importance of individual \"adjustment.\" It tracks the rise of the idea that talking about one's problems promotes recovery and healing, and how the initiative to seek therapy became a responsibility of the individual. It will do so by looking at the various instantiations of talking cures and consider the role of medications and other bodily cures in providing treatments for both severely ill patients and the \"worried well.\"",

From \"Chinese opium\" in the 19th c. to \"Hillbilly heroin\" (as OxyContin was once labeled) and from \"crack\" cocaine to menthol cigarettes and marijuana, we examine the forces shaping drug policies, how policies are transformed, why they change, and what drug laws reveal about society. We also examine how social, political, and economic circumstances shape drug policies, and how the US built a vast system governing people and the substances they can and cannot use.",

Public discourse and academia in the U.S. often dismiss Marx and the Marxist method: economic determinism at its worst; simplistically teleological; Marxists ignore race, gender, culture, and the environment; the Communist Manifesto sums it all up; Soviet totalitarianism proved its utopian failure. Is all this true? Let's test it. Let's take Marxism seriously. This course begins with fundamental works by Marx, Engels, Luxemburg, Preobrazhensky, Trotsky, and Lenin and then expands to study how the social and natural sciences have used the method to explain key processes in their domains.",

Working with rare books and manuscripts from the American Revolutionary era at Firestone, students will contribute to campus commemoration of the nation's 250th by deepening our knowledge of Princeton's collections. Along the way, we will investigate how archives and library collections are created, how they evolve, and how they shape historical scholarship. Whose voices do archives preserve or exclude? How do historians navigate them and grapple with their limits? And how are archives being transformed in the present?",

With intensive reading in an array of primary sources, including speeches, manifestos, private letters, poetry, and more, supplemented with pertinent secondary readings, it inquires into  how antislavery fitfully moved from the margins of American politics and culture to become, by the middle of the nineteenth century, a mass political movement that won national political power and sparked the Civil War.",

This course examines the histories and ongoing impacts of both movements. The course takes an intersectional approach to discussing the movements, examining how race, gender, sex, and class shaped migrants' experiences and shaped how Black migrants were able to remake the nation's politics and culture.",

But quite what counts as liberalism and how we should understand its flaws has been a point of continual debate. In this course, we take a historical perspective on these criticisms, looking at the traditions of political and social thought that have challenged liberalism across the 19th and 20th centuries. We focus on Marxism and Catholic social theory, both in their moments of most radical criticism of liberalism and in their periodic attempts to reconcile with it.",

This international success, however, was by no means preordained. Tailored to the conditions of a rapidly industrializing Western Europe, Marxist ideas were not easily applied elsewhere. This course examines how theorists sought to revise and adapt Marxist theory to fit the requirements of their time and place. The course pays attention to the way in which intellectuals from a range of countries challenged some of the core principles of Marxism, proposing new ideas about the role of the nation, religion, and race.",

How might we imagine and interrogate humanistic intellectual traditions populating the Near East including philosophy, literature, arts, poetry, among others? In what ways are such intellectual disciplines related to each other? What are the central questions, concerns, and aspirations that animated the intellectual lives of scholars from the Near East invested in traditions of knowledge we today call the\n\"humanities\"? These are among the questions that will occupy our inquiry in this class.",

Such discussions assume mid-20th Century fascism to be a rupture or aberration in a fundamentally sound Western civilization built around the institutions of liberal democracy and capitalism. This seminar will disrupt these assumptions, exploring ways that political authoritarianism and genocidal practices have been intrinsic to, and inseparable from, capitalist modernity.",

From the global Spanish and Portuguese missionary activities to the transpacific journey of chocolate connecting Mexican and Philippine cultures, we will examine how the project of Iberian expansion for spiritual and territorial conquest shaped the cultural landscapes of the early modern Pacific world. Students will engage with folding screens, statues, paintings, news pamphlets, letters, suits of armor, coins, beverages, and books.",

This course will choose some of the most provocative and influential iterations of the theme. We encourage students to approach the subject from a variety of disciplinary perspectives: literary, musical, historical, artistic, philosophical, religious, scientific.",

                "description": "In this seminar, we read the history and philosophy of the body as a locus of sense. We focus on the body's sense of self, others, and the world. Readings cluster in both the Ancient Greek and Latin texts that became integral to the later theorization of the physical body and its relation to the world and twentieth- and twenty-first century phenomenologies of the body that emphasize intercorporeality. We pay particular attention to the thresholds between self and others, body and world, and theory and practice. The course also includes movement workshops with guest dancers/choreographers.",

In a socio-political context, food, or the lack thereof, defines a society and its inadequacies. It becomes an agent of power, a metaphor for sex and gender, as well as a means of community. Whether as desire or transgression, whether corporal or spiritual - the representation of food is the depiction of Italian life. This course will examine translated Italian texts, along with visual art and film, in order to explore the function of eating, both as biological necessity as well as metaphor, within Italian society.",

Students will study Trenton's industrial history, report on local environmental issues, and interview activists, advocates, and scientists.

In this course, we will address this question by arguing, both philosophically and historically, that Mexican narcos are neither mere criminals nor terrorist, but rather micro-sovereigns. Some of the thinkers and artists who will help us understand the concept of micro-sovereignty include Thomas Hobbes, Michel Foucault, Oswaldo Zavala, Luis Estrada and Mónica Ojeda.",

                "description": "In 8 CE, Ovid was banished from Rome under mysterious circumstances. On the coast of the Black Sea, he wrote poetry that reflected on and sought reprieve from his exile. For centuries afterwards, poets who found themselves in states of exile or alienation used these works as models for Latin poems that made sense of their lot. In the first half of this class, we will read deeply from Ovid's works. Then, we will turn to poets from Late Antiquity into modernity who drew from them. Our reading will help us think about the relationship between poetry and home, questions of genre in Latin poetry, and the human experience of exile.",

Since then, the Bellum Civile has been read as a republican call to arms, a Stoic hagiography, a document of nihilism, even a work of history. We'll discuss the epic's genre and structure, its relationships with other texts, its politics and philosophy, and its persistent images such as dismemberment, haunting, and disease. We'll also look at Lucan's wildly varying reputation from the poem's first publication to contemporary criticism. We'll read three books in Latin and the whole poem in English.",

Deaf people in the UK and US might share the same written language, but their sign languages come from different language families. Some sign languages were developed recently, giving linguists an unprecedented opportunity to study how a language emerges. This course explores different sign languages and how they have been shaped by social, cultural, and political factors. It also examines how studying different perspectives on sign language may inform linguistics, disability studies, and other areas of study.",

Does your native language influence your perception, your behavior, and your culture? How does your identity influence properties of your language? What happens when unrelated languages come into contact for prolonged periods? How are new languages born? Why was English only recently (and controversially) made the official language of the US? We will explore these questions (and more) by engaging with the often contradictory opinions of specialists and the public, as well as with the empirical realities behind these different language situations.",

Do all languages build words in the same way(s), with the same sorts of ingredients? How similar is word-building to sentence-building? We will engage deeply with both the empirical and theoretical side of this topic, exploring not just morphology, but also its interactions with phonology (sound systems) and syntax (sentence structure). This class will be highly interactive and hands-on, and students will develop tools of analysis and argumentation that are applicable in all areas of linguistics and beyond.",

We consider the effects of bilingualism on other cognitive domains, including memory, and examine neurolinguistic evidence comparing the brains of monolinguals and bilinguals. Societal and governmental attitudes toward bilingualism in countries like India and the U.S. are contrasted.",

What new patterns emerge when grammar operates beyond the sentence? How do language structures vary across genres and why? What counts as an obligatory rule of language, and how do speakers creatively bend the rules? Special attention is given to spoken texts in non-Indo-European languages, expanding our knowledge of linguistic diversity and pushing us to rethink even very familiar grammatical systems.",

The focus is on developing satisfying analyses of interesting phonological patterns, drawing on existing theoretical tools where they are useful. Our goal is not to use linguistic data to try to justify any particular theory, but to see how various tools of phonological analysis can be used to simplify sound patterns which can be quite complex on the surface.",

The goal of this course is to cover some of the recent developments in the area. We start with simple theorems about forbidden induced subgraphs, and work our way up to the latest research results. The topics include perfect graphs, claw-free graphs, coloring graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs, algorithms for detecting induced subgraphs and others.",

We then focus on human reproductive biology, highlighting age and environment-induced fertility issues, as well as cutting edge research into fertility treatments and assisted reproductive technologies employed in clinics which combat these issues.",

A device to instantly access to all of humanities knowledge by the mere push of a button sounded like a fever dream merely 60 years ago.\n\nMaterials Science allows us to manipulate materials and shape them into useful form. Each week we will explore a new class of materials like moldable clay, colorful glass or tough metal. Lectures will focus on the materials influence on human progress and underlying science. Labs will bring you in close contact with these materials.",

On Broadway, at universities, at high schools, community theatres, and summer camps, most shows that are performed have been performed before. As musical theater scholars, how do we think about, research, analyze, and interpret revivals? As musical theater artists, how do we navigate revivals and the history of a show? In this seminar, we'll explore the scholarship and the practice of musicals, afterlives, discussing theories of revivals and examining and re-conceptualizing shows. Aspiring directors, music directors, designers, and performers can put your ideas about revivals into practice.",

And how do we use these devices to create drama in music - to express conflict or resolution - to tell a story? We will consider these questions by examining examples from the 18th to the 21st centuries and across multiple genres. The course is designed to enhance your skills in recognizing and understanding processes in tonal and post-tonal music and in composing harmonically-based music.",

In this course we delve into all of the genre's marvelous eccentricities: its use of classical, early modern, and modern literature; the role of star singers in shaping the genre; the presentation of gender and sexuality, race, class, and age; opera production, past and present; and operatic-style entertainments from other cultures (including Peking Opera). Students may have the opportunity to attend a live opera performance.",

During this time, Eurocentric models gave way to a dizzyingly diverse array of styles and attitudes, calling the very identity of concert music into question. Topics include high modernism; experimental explorations; noise and silence; technology; spirituality; music for film and dance; interculturalism and cultural appropriation; commodification; acoustic ecology; politics; and identity and diversity. We ask, where does concert music 'fit' in today's cultural landscape? What is its nature, and where do its boundaries lie? And whose music is it?",

Repertoire discussed includes Schoenberg, Babbitt, and Feldman, and both \"dissonant\" and \"consonant\" abstraction. Besides active seminar participation, formal requirements include written responses to the listening/viewing assignments, music and dance analyses, and a final research paper on a pre-approved topic.",

Most famous books, from the I Ching to The Odyssey to the Bible, have come down to us copied by hand. Yet manuscripts are not just vehicles for texts: they have their own stories to tell and carry the traces of scribes, craftspeople, booksellers, owners, readers, and doodlers. The class meets in Special Collections and centers experiential learning, including handling historical materials, reading the evidence embedded in writing surfaces, inks, and layouts, and executing traditional bookmaking techniques.",

Drawing on critical theory, as well as premodern and modern literature in translation, we examine how the Islamic tradition positions itself towards the societal margin, how the margin can be used as a method of research (social and material histories), and how it structures the cosmic order (the Islamic barzakh). Throughout the course, we seek to dislodge the margin-center binary by exposing its entanglements in the modern order of knowledge, envisioning alternatives from the Islamic tradition instead.",

It seeks to identify the factors that have driven American policy, placing theoretical perspectives that emphasize geopolitical and balance-of-power considerations alongside those that focus on domestic politics and regime type. What are American objectives in Eurasia and how have they evolved? What roles do ideas, institutions, and individuals play in the formulation and execution of foreign policy?",

It seeks to understand the responses of the latter on their own terms, and to relate them to each other.

NEU250 is intended to be a credit-bearing P/D/F course. Students will gain research experience in the laboratory of a faculty member in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. Students are expected to work with their faculty mentor to develop a schedule that involves spending 10 hours per week engaged in research, including attending weekly research meetings and reading research papers. At the end of the semester, students will present their findings to the faculty member and research group.",

Methods include intracellular and extracellular recording of neural activity at scales from single to hundreds of neurons; the application of optogenetic approaches to manipulate neuronal function and behavior; and noninvasive measurement of human cognitive information processing using EEG and fMRI. The capstone of the course is a 2-week independent research project designed and carried out by students.",

Through discussion-based seminars, we traverse major developmental events of the brain, tracing development at prenatal and postnatal stages through the protracted stages of young adulthood and aging. Insights into basic mechanisms come from animal models, but recent technological advancements - including the development of human in vitro models such as organoids - enable studies of human brain maturation directly. We examine how brain development is related to evolution, and how typical and atypical development influence function.",

The cerebellum's microcircuit architecture is largely conserved, so that its local information processing can provide a rigorous starting point for analysis. Cerebellar function will be considered in terms of evolution, development, microcircuit physiology, connectomics, long-distance connectivity to the rest of the brain, animal behavior, and human function and dysfunction, including autism. Readings will draw on original literature, and weekly discussions will be led partly by students.",

This leads us on a journey through the dynamic programming principle, the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equations, the notion of viscosity solution, up to the theory of BSDEs.",

It also underscores our ability to communicate thoughts to each other. How is this possible? And how is it that our sentences are meaningful to begin with? This course is an introduction to semantics, the study of linguistic meaning. You will learn about formal tools and techniques of semantic theory that allow us to develop formally precise theories of linguistic meaning.",

                "description": "The 17th century was a period of tumult and change in Europe. The Reformation had broken the hold of the Catholic Church, challenging long-held orthodoxies. Religion was also confronted by the Scientific Revolution, challenging comfortable beliefs about the world and our place in it. This led philosophers to rethink basic issues concerning religion. Who is telling us the truth, the Church or the scientist? Who is in charge, the religious or civil authorities? Is there really a God, and how can we know? This course will focus on these and other questions using primary textual readings from a variety of sources across the early modern period.",

We look closely at the theory to see whether this implication is warranted, and if not, what alternative pictures of material objects are consistent with the deliverances of contemporary physics.",

Students will learn the core methods for analyzing static and dynamic games, including finitely and infinitely repeated games. Emphasis will be placed on developing intuition for strategic behavior in political environments - such as elections, public good provision, legislative bargaining, and agenda setting. Designed for first- and second-year students, the course aims to spark interest in formal political analysis and provide a good foundation for further study in game theory and political economy.",

Drawing on a mix of history and social science, we will come to understand why certain segments of America oppose the full inclusion of African Americans. We will also discuss the political strategies undertaken by the Black community to combat social, political, and economic injustices. The first half of the course will focus on historical antecedents such as the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement. The second half of the course will focus on the nature of contemporary racial attitudes in the 21st century.",

Populist political leaders charge that the so-called \"deep state\" is anti-democratic: insufficiently controlled by elected officials and democratic publics. Must we choose between decision-making adequately informed by expertise and government by the people? Or is the delegation of authority to decisionmakers insulated from partisan political pressures one way of engaging in collective self-rule? This seminar explores these controversies from historical, empirical, and normative perspectives.",

We will then move through the course both historically and thematically, examining when and why certain threats manifest, and how the nation's institutions responded.",

First part of the course introduces probability theory, while second part develops the necessary large-sample (asymptotic) theory. These foundational concepts are then applied in the third and fourth parts of the course to study maximum likelihood methods and linear regression. A distinguishing feature of the fourth part of the course is an emphasis on different interpretations of the linear regression model, specifically distinguishing between descriptive and structural (causal) uses of linear regression.",

With that in mind, we first explain how texts may be modeled as quantitative entities and discuss how they might be compared.  We then move to both supervised and unsupervised techniques in some detail, before dealing with some `special topics' that arise in particular lines of social science research.",

PSY 230 is a non-credit bearing class while PSY 231 carries a full unit of credit (both are graded P/D/F). Students will gain an introduction to research within a Psychology lab. Students are expected to spend a minimum of 6 hours per week engaged in research and attend weekly meetings as outlined by the mentoring faculty. At the end of each semester, students will submit a written report of their research experience (PSY 230) and present their findings (PSY 231).",

                "description": "Decision-making is ubiquitous to everyday life and crucial to survival. Good choice is subject to evolutionary selection; poor choice accompanies many neurological and psychiatric disorders. But theoretical understanding of a function is needed to manipulate and measure it experimentally. Recently, this has led scientists studying choice to seek insights from economics. This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, focusing on how psychological and neural mechanisms implement, or fail to implement, economic theories of choice. We consider choice in many sorts of tasks; eg, in animal foraging and human competitive interactions.",

The ease with which we perform these skills belies their overwhelming computational complexity, and we overlook how important motor skills are in our everyday lives. This course will examine how the nervous system controls movements, how the brain handles computational complexities of movement, how motor skills are learned and consolidated, and how the motor system influences cognition.",

The primary goal of your independent work is to make sure you learn how to understand, conduct, and communicate empirical research. The yearlong thesis course aims to assist you in attaining this goal via assignments that promote consistent investment in and attention to the thesis throughout the academic year. PSY majors complete PSY 498 in the fall (graded P/D/F) and PSY 499 (letter graded) in the spring. In the spring, seniors submit a full thesis draft in March and their final thesis in April; students must receive a passing grade in PSY 498 to enroll in PSY 499.",

More than it is commonly realized, people's experiences shape and are shaped by their thoughts, feelings, and behavior. In this course, we cover a range of social psychology topics, emphasizing ideas represented within our department and continually thinking about people as being fundamentally socially embedded.",

We will then focus on animal regulatory genomics, with a particular emphasis on gene regulation in mammalian genomes. \nA distinctive property of animal genomes is long-range communication between remote enhancers and their target genes. Enhancers can map over a megabase away from genes controlling developmental and disease processes in humans and other mammals. We will discuss the underlying mechanisms for such long-range control of gene activity, considering both biophysical and experimental genomics methodologies.",

By looking at practices and teachings that do not easily map onto monotheistic traditions, we will question commonly held assumptions about religion. This course introduces major themes and issues in Japanese religions from ancient to modern times, focusing on the role of religion in culture and history. We will examine aspects of Buddhist, Shinto, Christian and other traditions, as well as topics such as myths, indigeneity, politics, secularism, and violence.",

Finally, we consider whether religious commitment might be rationally acceptable without any proof or evidence, and whether the real-world fact of religious diversity has philosophical implications.

Next we address these topics: assisted reproduction, genetic control, abortion, euthanasia and the right to die, informed consent, paternalism, confidentiality, just allocation of scarce resources, limits on research protocols, & cloning.",

Through close readings of Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Jain sources, we will examine narrative confrontations challenging the ethics of gods, philosophical critiques of rival traditions, and polemical debates over the supremacy of specific deities. Along the way, we will pay special attention to the technical language and structures of sastra, learning how to follow extended prose arguments, identify the purvapaksa and siddhanta, and read commentaries.",

                "description": "This course examines the formative period of Indian philosophical thought, tracing its development from the pre-philosophical worldviews found in ancient Vedic literature to the systematic metaphysical frameworks that crystallized during the early centuries of the Common Era. Students examine how mythological concepts of creation, reality, time, space, etc., evolved into sophisticated philosophical categories within distinct traditions. Through close reading of primary texts in translation and secondary scholarship, the course explores the transformation from ritual cosmology to rigorous philosophical discourse.",

What will labor look like, particularly when the idea of the human rooted in labor has influenced Marxist, feminist, anti-colonial, and anti-caste struggles? In this seminar, students will examine humans' intertwined and contradictory relation to work. Through histories of caste, race, gender, and class that shape our understanding of what it means to be a worker, we will discuss the question of value in techno-capitalism. Students will read accounts of different workplaces from the Global South to discuss anti-work politics and post-work worlds.",

Students will learn to analyze a rich body of works produced in the Soviet Union, including avant-garde poetry and movies, official and underground artists and writers, and Princeton's extensive collection of late-socialist posters. In the analysis, we will focus especially on the relationship between cultural production and the shifting political and ideological demands of the regime and on the role of writers and artists in society.",

Both took a symphonic approach to truth: Kierkegaard by writing under a series of pseudonyms, and Dostoevsky by creating a \"dialogic\" universe in which radically opposing voices clash. Both writers were master humorists, deploying both earnestness and irony in confronting life's cursed questions. By reading them together, we will allow them to dialogically illuminate one another as we address fundamental questions of what it means to exist in freedom and subjectivity.",

He chronicles life in the U.S. focusing on a range of topics from loneliness, community, and freedom, to teen pregnancy, street car racing, and immigration. Class sessions will highlight one or more songs and academic literature to learn what sociology can teach about the issues raised by Springsteen's music. The seminar will be an opportunity to interrogate a vision of America - a country riven by politics but that is more then the sum of its politics.",

                "description": "By taking a comparative approach, this course examines the role of social, economic, and political factors in the emergence and transformation of modern cities in the United States and selected areas of Latin America.  We consider the city in its dual image: both as a center of progress and as a redoubt of social problems, especially poverty.  Attention is given to spatial processes that have resulted in the aggregation and desegregation of populations differentiated by social class and race.",

Our two main goals will be to a) engage critically with authors and ideas and b) to develop your own 'sociological eye' and theoretical skills. Key authors will include Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Dubois, Schutz, Goffman, Bourdieu, Foucault. We will put these authors in their historical contexts and also ask how they can be used now to interpret contemporary issues and events.",

Students will improve their linguistic proficiency while exploring the various mechanisms that affect how our identity is constructed, negotiated, and/or imposed. Particularly, the course will examine the ways in which gender and national identities develop and consolidate themselves by exploring cultural production (journalism, literature, cinema and the visual arts, etc.) in the Spanish speaking world and beyond.",

The passions aroused by Helen of Troy brought down a city and made Homer's masterpiece possible, while the foolishness of those in love inspired Shakespeare and Cervantes to create their most memorable characters. Many powerful Latin American and Spanish stories deal with the force and effects of love. In this course, we will study a group of films and literary fictions that focus on different kinds and forms of love. We will pay special attention to the forms of narrative love (quest, courting, adultery, heartbreaking), as well as the translation of love into language, body, and image.",

We focus on how microeconomics can help us understand the effects of alternative public policies. We begin by studying how individuals and firms make consumption, labor, and production decisions, how consumers and firms interact in a competitive market, and how taxes and regulations affect market outcomes. We then introduce Game Theory. We study imperfect competition, externalities and public goods, market failures, and the political economy of government intervention.",

However, there are many cases in which human behavior systematically differ from this benchmark. The goal of this class is to discuss these cases: when do they tend to occur, what form do they take, how to model them. We will discuss how people relate to the presence of risk, intertemporal choice, fairness, complexity, etc. For each topic, we will discuss the empirical evidence and leading models. Overall, this class will offer an introduction to one of the most exciting areas of research in economics.",

Rising seas, stronger storms, and shifting temperatures are adding new pressures to the familiar social, economic, and political drivers of migration. This course explores how these environmental changes interact with local contexts to influence who moves, when and why.  We will build on classic ideas in migration studies and ask how those ideas need to be adapted for a changing climate. Through examples from different regions, we will compare diverse migration responses to climate stress and identify broader patterns that cut across contexts.",

Special emphasis is given to central banks as unique policymaking institutions and, especially, to the Federal Reserve System, although other central banks are mentioned frequently. Since the focus is on monetary policy, the course presupposes a working knowledge of the relevant macroeconomics, but particular aspects thereof are taught in the course. Attention is paid to the causes, consequences, and central bank behavior during and since the financial crisis and the Covid-19 crisis, and also to current events.",

In particular, we will focus on blackness as both lived experience and as a mode of theoretical inquiry.",

Each class is made up of individual and ensemble-based physical and vocal exercises to bolster creative thinking and to ready the body and voice for performance. We will find inspiration in readings and short performance texts. Students will leave the semester with a strong foundation for further acting courses or projects in all genres.",

But alongside the fun, black people in the U.S. dealt with heightened criminalization and poverty codified through the War on Drugs, welfare reform, HIV/AIDS, and police brutality. We will study the various cultural productions of black performers and consumers as they navigated the social and political landscapes of the 1990s. We will examine works growing out of music, televisual media, fashion, and public policy, using theories from performance and cultural studies to understand the specificities of blackness, gender, class, and sexuality.",

We'll use primary sources to explore urban street life from ancient times to the present: how movement was experienced and organized, how jams and crashes were explained, and how our modern transport system emerged. Meanwhile, we'll use works of theory to connect traffic to ideas about other kinds of circulation: of blood, money, information, et al. By the end of class, students will be able to situate modern traffic, with its automated vehicles, policing, and routinized death, within a larger story about how we share space.",

We explore privately-developed tenements and row houses, government-built housing, publicly-subsidized suburban homes and cooperatives, as well as housing developed through incentives and subsidies. Students will analyze the balance between public and private, free market and subsidy, and preservation and renewal. Close attention will be paid to the role of race in structuring the relationship between policymakers, property owners, renters, and homeowners.",

We'll introduce basic techniques while also encouraging experimentation, with a focus on both drawing from life and drawing as an expressive act. Students will be introduced to the basics of line, shading, proportion, composition, texture and gesture. You'll also maintain a drawing journal, and use it as a regular space for observation and personal expression. Through exposure to a variety of mediums and techniques, you'll gain the skills and confidence necessary to develop an individual final project of your choosing.",

Through hands-on exercises and projects, this course aims to demystify the web, removing barriers to basic web coding and publishing by focusing on the foundational skills in making websites with HTML and CSS.

VIS 415 is structured around one semester-length assignment which connects graphic design to the design of software interfaces. The single project allows an individual in-depth investigation of a broader class assignment and will leverage the online setting with students working together to refine their individual projects through a mix of critique and user testing. Studio work is supplemented by guests, readings, and lectures. The course will explore information design and visual problem solving specifically for electronic media.",
